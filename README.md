## Hi, I’m Venkata Subrahmanya Dakshina Murthy 👋

I’m a B.Tech Computer Science (AI & ML) student focused on **technical documentation**, **automation**, and **open-source contributor experience**.

### What I’m doing now
- Building a public, evidence-backed learning portfolio (learning in public)
- Learning RPA with UiPath (Studio Web, Automation Starter)
- Studying how documentation and systems fail at integration boundaries
- Preparing for DevRel / Technical Writing roles (Summer 2026)

### Recent milestone
- Opened my first external documentation PR against a Tier-1 security repository (1Password)
- Maintainer confirmed the issue was already resolved upstream and closed it as outdated
- Outcome validated correct issue triage and professional open-source workflow

➡️ **Primary portfolio (daily logs, evidence, PRs):**

### Background
- Languages: English, Hindi, Telugu
- Interests: Documentation systems, automation, governance, DX
- Location: India

I value clarity, correctness, and honest documentation over superficial activity.

> Note: AI tools are used for writing clarity only. All technical decisions, commits, and contributions are my own.
